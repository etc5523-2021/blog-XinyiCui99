# Introduction

This blog explored the status of the world largest economies and well-developed country United States in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. 


# Data description

The data comes from **Our World in Data** on [github](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/). The table below is the variables and there corresponding description.

# United States and Covid

To explore the key aspects in terms of the daily confirmed cases, daily confirmed deaths cases and daily hospital cases over time in the US.

```{r}
 owid_covid_data %>% 
  filter(location == "United States")
```


```{r}
trend1 <- owid_covid_data %>%
  mutate(new_hospital = hosp_patients - lag(hosp_patients)) %>% 
  select(c(date, new_cases, new_deaths, new_hospital)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("new_cases","new_deaths","new_hospital"),
               names_to = "Type",
               values_to = "cases")
 

colors <- c(new_cases = '#079CF5', new_deaths = '#72BEEC', new_hospital='#C5E5F8')
```

```{r trend}

             y = cases,
             color = Type)) +
  geom_col(stat = "identity")+
  facet_wrap(~Type, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y")+

ggplotly(p1)
```

New Cases:
- US is experiencing the second major wave of confirmed new cases.
- On 02 Jan 2021, the daily confirmed cases reached the peak of **300462** cases.

New death:
- In general, there is a positive relationship between confirmed daily cases and daily confirmed deaths.
- The first wave of death started from April 2020 while the confirmed cases were relatively low.

New hospital:
- The negative cases of **new_hospital** represented people who no longer need to be monitored in the hospital
- The number of people in hospital was very high, as may people were panicking about the COVID-19.


# Vaccinations in United States

![](vaccine.jpeg)

United States has the world leading position in health care, medical treatment and pharmaceuticals markets (Pharmapproach,2020)

There are three authorized and recommended vaccines in US. They are **BioNTech, Pfizer vaccine**, **Johnson & Johnson vaccine** and **Moderna, NIAID vaccine**. (CDC, 2021) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention USA, that all these are safe, effective and reduce the risk of severe illness caused by Covid-19. More information about US vaccination [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html).


```{r}
vacc <- owid_covid_data %>% 
  select(c(date, people_fully_vaccinated, people_vaccinated)) %>% 
  filter(date >= "2020-12-20") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date)) +
  geom_area(aes(y = people_vaccinated), fill = "#6DCBDF")+
  geom_area(aes(y = people_fully_vaccinated), fill = "#47A4B8")+
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Number of people vaccinated",
       title = "Vaccination status in United States")+
   annotate("text",
           x = as.Date("2021-02-02"),
           y = 200000000,
           label = "vaccinated at least 1 dose",
           color=  "#6DCBDF") +
   annotate("text",
           x = as.Date("2021-02-02"),
           y = 180000000,
           label = "people fully vaccinated",
           color = "#47A4B8") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "60 days",date_labels = "%d-%m-%Y")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = ~scales::number(.,big.mark = ","))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=20, hjust = 1)) +
  theme_minimal()+
  transition_reveal(date)

animate(plot = vacc, 
        renderer = gifski_renderer(),
        fps = 10)
anim_save("out.gif")
```

This animation demonstrates the vaccination status in the US, with light blue represents people who had vaccinated at lease 1 dose, dark blue of people who had been fully vaccinated.
